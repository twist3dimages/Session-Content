HISTORY
    See http://psmsi.codeplex.com/releases for up-to-date information.

    2.2.0
        This release adds many new cmdlets from the past release, including
        cmdlets to select records from a table or custom query, run ICEs on a
        package, and install, repair, or uninstall packages. The install,
        repair, and uninstall cmdlets also display progress, warning, and
        error information. Some issues were fixed as well.

        The snap-in installer has been removed in favor of the module
        installer - a per-user install that will upgrade any previous version.
        You may also install the package to a per-machine location, though
        elevation is required. This will make the module accessible to any
        host for any user on the machine.
