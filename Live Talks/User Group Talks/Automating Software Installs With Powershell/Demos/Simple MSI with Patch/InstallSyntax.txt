Install Silent
msiexec /i AcroRead.msi TRANSFORMS=AcroRead.mst /qn /l*v C:\Windows\Temp\AdobeReaderInstall.log

Patch Silent
msiexec.exe /p AdbeRdrUpd11010.msp /qn REINSTALLMODE="ecmus" REINSTALL="ALL"

From within an OSD Task Sequence, the Install and Patch (Transforms/MST and Patch/MSP)can't be run in the same step. 
Two Programs were created and run sequentially as a workaround.
